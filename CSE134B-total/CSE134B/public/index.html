        <p style="font-size:20px">Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. 
        The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. 
        Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. 
        Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and styles of play. 
        During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's heroes and other defenses.
         A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".
